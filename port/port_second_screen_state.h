/*
 * Thread-safe game-state snapshot for the second-screen render thread.
 *
 * Modeled on port_m4a_backend.cpp's sStateMutex pattern: the game thread
 * publishes a small copy of the fields the second screen needs once per
 * tick; the second-screen render thread only ever reads that published
 * copy, never gSave/gRoomControls/gPlayerEntity directly. Lock is held only
 * for a memcpy on both sides — never around anything that renders or
 * blocks, so the second-screen thread can never stall the game thread.
 *
 * Input flows the other way through the same file: the UI thread requests
 * an equip (tap on the item grid) via Port_SecondScreenState_RequestEquip;
 * Publish() applies it on the game thread through the engine's own
 * ForceEquipItem, so the save file is only ever touched from the thread
 * that owns it.
